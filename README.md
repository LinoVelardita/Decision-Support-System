# Decision-Support-System

This project implements an ETL process using Python, SQL, SSIS, and Power BI to manage and analyze data efficiently.

## Part 1
The database schema was designed by replicating a reference data warehouse model, with simplifications such as removing degenerate dimensions. Key fields like custody, incident, and date IDs are stored as integers, while other identifiers (participant, gun, and geographic IDs) are stored as strings.

Geographic data was retrieved via reverse geocoding using the Google Maps API, transforming latitude and longitude into city and state information. To ensure unique geographic IDs, a custom encoding was applied to the coordinates.

Missing IDs for participants, locations, and firearms were generated by concatenating key attributes, creating compact, unique identifiers that categorize entities without storing detailed incident or personal data.

The data loading process involved reading multiple sources, calculating missing values, and handling common errors like duplicate or foreign key violations, ensuring a smooth integration of data into the database.
