# Decision-Support-System

This project implements an ETL process using Python, SQL, SSIS, and Power BI to manage and analyze data efficiently.

## Part 1
The database schema was designed by replicating a reference data warehouse model, with simplifications such as removing degenerate dimensions. Key fields like custody, incident, and date IDs are stored as integers, while other identifiers (participant, gun, and geographic IDs) are stored as strings.

Geographic data was retrieved via reverse geocoding using the Google Maps API, transforming latitude and longitude into city and state information. To ensure unique geographic IDs, a custom encoding was applied to the coordinates.

Missing IDs for participants, locations, and firearms were generated by concatenating key attributes, creating compact, unique identifiers that categorize entities without storing detailed incident or personal data.

The data loading process involved reading multiple sources, calculating missing values, and handling common errors like duplicate or foreign key violations, ensuring a smooth integration of data into the database.

## Part 2
SSIS was used to handle various data transformation tasks, with results saved in CSV files. Below are the key operations performed:

Total Custodies by Year: Custody records were grouped by year, counting the total number of custodies.

Identifying Youth Criminal Problem States: States were flagged as having a youth criminal problem if individuals under 18 contributed more to crime severity than adults. The data was grouped by state and age group, and the crime severity was compared.

Crime Severity Ratio for Stolen vs. Non-Stolen Guns: For each incident, the ratio of crime severity involving stolen guns to that involving non-stolen guns was calculated. Incidents without non-stolen guns were excluded from the calculation.

## Part 3
Building a data cube, performing MDX queries, and creating Power BI dashboards to analyze crime-related data.

Data Cube Construction: A data cube with dimensions for custody, date, gun, and participant was built, with measures like crime gravity and gun count to support the analysis.

MDX Queries: Several queries were performed, including calculating year-over-year crime gravity changes by state, the percentage of crime gravity per gun type, and identifying incidents with gravity above the state average.

Power BI Dashboards: Visualizations were created to show the geographical distribution of crime gravity by age group, gender-based differences in crime involvement, and the prevalence of stolen versus non-stolen guns over time.
